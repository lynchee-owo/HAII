| Attribute         | GitHub Copilot | ChatGPT |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Developer         | GitHub and OpenAI | OpenAI |
| Use Case          | Code completion within IDEs | Summarizing complex code, generating starting templates for coding tasks |
| Integration       | Integrated directly with IDEs like Visual Studio, VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains | Accessed as a separate tool |
| Language Scope    | Focused on programming language tasks | Can handle a broader range of questions, including general language tasks |
| Training Data     | Trained on vast amounts of code from GitHub and elsewhere | Trained on general human language data |
| Cost              | Starts at $10/month for individuals, $19/month for businesses | $20/month subscription for latest language model |
| Functionality     | Provides lines of code, variables, function names relevant to the context of code being written. Acts as a code completion agent. Can learn from developers' code to improve its suggestions and accuracy | Capable of automating customer service interactions, content generation, explaining code concepts, generating function and unit tests |
| Strengths         | Excellent at generating code snippets and suggestions based on context. Tight integration into IDEs provides efficient, real-time coding support. Learns from developers' code to improve suggestions | Flexibility in communication through chat-like interface. Generates wide range of code responses and explanations. Useful for nontechnical stakeholders |
| Weaknesses        | May generate incorrect or inefficient code suggestions. May not be suitable for complex programming tasks requiring extensive knowledge and expertise | May struggle with complex or technical language. Not always accurate or relevant in responses. May not be suitable for applications requiring real-time interactions |
| Future Developments | GitHub recently announced Copilot X, which promises to combine some of the best features of Copilot and GPT. This vision suggests plans to automate more aspects of the development experience | Potentially could be integrated directly into IDEs, enabling developers to communicate with it and request it to perform routine tasks such as checking out code from repositories, running tests or building code |
