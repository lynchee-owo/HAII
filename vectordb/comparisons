  "Qdrant": {
    "About": "Qdrant is a vector similarity engine & vector database. It deploys as an API service providing search for the nearest high-dimensional vectors. With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more! Provides the OpenAPI v3 specification to generate a client library in almost any programming language. Alternatively utilise ready-made client for Python or other programming languages with additional functionality. Implement a unique custom modification of the HNSW algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search. Search with a State-of-the-Art speed and apply search filters without compromising on results. Support additional payload associated with vectors. Not only stores payload but also allows filter results based on payload values.",

  "Pinecone": {
    "About": "Long-term memory for AI. The Pinecone vector database makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications. Developer-friendly, fully managed, and easily scalable without infrastructure hassles. Once you have vector embeddings, manage and search through them in Pinecone to power semantic search, recommenders, and other applications that rely on relevant information retrieval. Ultra-low query latency, even with billions of items. Give users a great experience. Live index updates when you add, edit, or delete data. Your data is ready right away. Combine vector search with metadata filters for more relevant and faster results. Launch, use, and scale your vector search service with our easy API, without worrying about infrastructure or algorithms. We'll keep it running smoothly and securely.",

  "Embeddinghub": {
    "About": "Operationalize your embeddings with one simple tool. Experience a comprehensive database designed to provide embedding functionality that, until now, required multiple platforms. Elevate your machine learning quickly and painlessly through Embeddinghub. Embeddings are dense, numerical representations of real-world objects and relationships, expressed as vectors. They are often created by first defining a supervised machine learning problem, known as a \"surrogate problem.\" Embeddings intend to capture the semantics of the inputs they were derived from, subsequently getting shared and reused for improved learning across machine learning models. Embeddinghub lets you achieve this in a streamlined, intuitive way.",
