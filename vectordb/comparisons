    "About": "Qdrant is a vector similarity engine & vector database. It deploys as an API service providing search for the nearest high-dimensional vectors. With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more! Provides the OpenAPI v3 specification to generate a client library in almost any programming language. Alternatively utilise ready-made client for Python or other programming languages with additional functionality. Implement a unique custom modification of the HNSW algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search. Search with a State-of-the-Art speed and apply search filters without compromising on results. Support additional payload associated with vectors. Not only stores payload but also allows filter results based on payload values.",
